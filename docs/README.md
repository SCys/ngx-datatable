# ngx-datatable

Forked by SCys

**old project is [here](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-datatable**

`ngx-datatable` is a Angular component for presenting large and complex data.  
It has all the features you would expect from any other table but in a light package
with _no external dependencies_. The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light;
it doesn't make any assumptions about your data or how you: filter, sort or page it.

It was built for modern browsers using _TypeScript, CSS3 and HTML5_ and Angular `>=4.0.0`.
This is the sister project of the [angular-data-table](https://github.com/swimlane/angular-data-table)
that is designed for Angular 1.x.
